## Research interests

I am focused on machine learning algorithms that can extract concepts from data. More specifically in unsupervised learning using feature learning, attention learning...

I focus my work on deep neural networks in a big data context. In my thesis I will adapt such technique in a few shots context.

## Summary

I am currently a phd student with [Julien Pinquier](https://www.irit.fr/~Julien.Pinquier/index_en.php) and [Jérôme Farinas](https://www.irit.fr/~Jerome.Farinas/).  
The project consists in creating an Automatic System of Inteligibility Measurement (SAMI).
It involves using clinical data, use of recent machine learning algorithms (such as neural networks) and some data analysis.

I obtained my master in computer science (artificial intelligence, pattern recognition and robotics) in 2015 at Paul Sabatier (Toulouse, France).
