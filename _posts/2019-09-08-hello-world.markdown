This is my first post to present myself and what my blog will contain.
I am Vincent a PhD student in Machine Learning at IRIT Toulouse. I use Deep Learning Techniques on speech signals with few data available (few shot context).
My blog will consist in sharing some of my reading, papers, tips about Machine Learning, Programming (I mainly use Python, LaTeX and Markdown languages) and Linux.

Stay tuned, I hope it will help my readers.

Cheers.
