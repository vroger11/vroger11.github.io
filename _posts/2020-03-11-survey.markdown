My new survey [is out](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13636-022-00251-w).
It reviews automatic techniques used for automatic speech recognition tasks from Large Corpora to Limited Data.
It includes an opening to few-shot techniques (to use few data to train the model) and first promising results over speech/audio signals.
Check it out.

Cheers, Vincent
