My new survey is out on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04241).
It reviews automatic techniques used for automatic speech recognition tasks from Large Corpora to Limited Data.
It includes an opening to few-shot techniques and first promising results over speech/audio signals.
Check it out.

I will eventually make videos on some techniques shown there but don't expect them before this summer.

Cheers, Vincent
