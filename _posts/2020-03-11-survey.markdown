My new survey is out on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04241).
It reviews automatic techniques used for automatic speech recognition tasks from Large Corpora to Limited Data.
It includes an opening to few-shot techniques (to use few data to train the model) and first promising results over speech/audio signals.
Check it out.

Cheers, Vincent
