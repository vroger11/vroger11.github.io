Hello again, it has been a while!

Recently, I did a presentation on Python libraries for data visualizations.
I compared them and presented usage examples.
All code and examples are available [here](https://github.com/vroger11/presentation-toulouse-dataviz).
If by any chances the slides do not work well for you, you can [download the pdf versions]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/presentations/tdv/python_tools_en.pdf) (with no animated elements).

If you understand French you can watch my presentation:
<div style="width : 1000px ; margin : 0 auto ;">
<iframe width="840" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rD3gNiAEauM?si=7koPpnl43Lcq2xWl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

It was a talk done for the Toulouse Dataviz association.
I hope this helps and/or inspires some of you.

See you again, Vincent.
