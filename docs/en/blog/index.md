This blog features articles on machine learning, visualizations I have created, as well as programming tips and advice on the Linux environment.

All articles are accessible from the sidebar on the left, sorted by date with the most recent ones at the top. On small screens and smartphones, use the hamburger menu to navigate.

You can also search for an article by its tag or use the categories below:

=== ":material-brain: Machine Learning"
    I run some benchmarks:

    - [Pandas, Polars, DuckDB on Categorical Parquet](2025/06-22-parquet-benchmark-pandas-polars-duckdb.md)

    I create tutorials:

    - [SpeechBot - how to quickly create a speech-to-speech agent](2025/03-17-speechbot-starting-point.md)

    - Generating images with [an unconditional model](2024/06-02-diffusers-unconditional-model.md); from [labels with a conditional model](2024/06-16-diffusers-conditional-model.md); and [improving the speed and quality of image generation](2024/09-08-diffusers-obtain-better-results.md).

    Additionally, I wrote a post on how to [speed up training on AI servers](2020/06-24-tweaks-to-speedup-AI-servers.md).

    During my PhD, I conducted a survey on few-shot techniques for audio processingâ€”[check it out here](2020/03-11-survey.md).

=== ":material-chart-line: Visualizations"
    In my spare time, I enjoy creating data visualizations. Most recently, I took part in the [2025 edition of Hackaviz](2025/04-07-hackaviz.md).

    Also, I covered some *Age of Empires 2* tournaments, which have garnered over 100k views. Some of my articles include:

    - [Red Bull Wololo Legacy](2022/12-08-redbull-wololo-legacy.md)
    - [Warlords](2022/12-13-warlords.md)
    - [The Grand Melee](2023/01-16-the_grand_melee.md)

    I also presented a [survey on Python data visualization tools](2023/12-03-tools-python-dataviz.md) for the Toulouse Dataviz association.

=== ":material-robot: Work automation"
    I've written several articles about automating various tasks during development. Here are a few highlights:

    - [Efficient Docker Builds with uv](2025/10-02-efficient-dockerfile-with-uv.md), to speed up and streamline Python dependency management in Docker.
    - [Save your Git credentials](2019/09-09-save-git-credentials.md) to avoid repeatedly entering your password.
    - [Automation with SSH keys](2020/08-02-automation-using-ssh-keys.md), where we explore useful tasks you can automate using SSH keys.
    - [Working remotely or from home](2020/03-18-work-at-home.md), detailing how to configure your workstations for remote access.
