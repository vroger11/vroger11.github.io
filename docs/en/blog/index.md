=== ":material-brain: Machine Learning"
    I created tutorials on how to create a speech-to-speech agent (named SpeechBot):

    1. [SpeechBot - how to quickly create a first version?](2025/03-17-speechbot-starting-point.md)

    Also, I've created tutorials on generating images using the Diffusers library:

    1. [Generating images with an unconditional model](2024/06-02-diffusers-unconditional-model.md).
    2. [Generating images from labels with a conditional model](2024/06-16-diffusers-conditional-model.md).
    3. [Improving the speed and quality of image generation](2024/09-08-diffusers-obtain-better-results.md).

    Additionally, I wrote a post on how to [speed up training on AI servers](2020/06-24-tweaks-to-speedup-AI-servers.md).

    During my PhD, I conducted a survey on few-shot techniques for audio processingâ€”[check it out here](2020/03-11-survey.md).

=== ":material-chart-line: Visualizations"
    In my spare time, I enjoy creating data visualizations. Most recently, I took part in the 2025 edition of Hackaviz.
    Have a look [here](2025/04-07-hackaviz.md).

    Also, I covered some *Age of Empires 2* tournaments, which have garnered over 100k views. Some of my articles include:

    - [Red Bull Wololo Legacy](2022/12-08-redbull-wololo-legacy.md)
    - [Warlords](2022/12-13-warlords.md)
    - [The Grand Melee](2023/01-16-the_grand_melee.md)

    I also presented a [survey on Python data visualization tools](2023/12-03-tools-python-dataviz.md) for the Toulouse Dataviz association.

=== ":material-robot: Work automation"
    I've written several articles about automating various tasks during development. Here are a few highlights:

    - [Save your Git credentials](2019/09-09-save-git-credentials.md) to avoid repeatedly entering your password.
    - [Automation with SSH keys](2020/08-02-automation-using-ssh-keys.md), where we explore useful tasks you can automate using SSH keys.
