I am a PhD student in Data Science at IRIT (Toulouse), I also started a blog [check it out](blog).

# Research interests

I am focused on machine learning algorithms that can extract concepts from data. More specifically in unsupervised learning using feature learning, attention learning...

In my thesis I will adapt Deep Neural Networks techniques in a few shots context for speech signals.

# Summary

I am currently a PhD student with [Julien Pinquier](https://www.irit.fr/~Julien.Pinquier/index_en.php) and [Jérôme Farinas](https://www.irit.fr/~Jerome.Farinas/).
The project consists in creating an Automatic System of Inteligibility Measurement (SAMI).
It involves using clinical data, use of recent machine learning algorithms (such as Deep Neural Network or Statistical models) and some data analysis.

I obtained my Master Degree in computer science (Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition and Robotics) in 2015 at Paul Sabatier (Toulouse, France).
